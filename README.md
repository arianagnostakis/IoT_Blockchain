# IoT_Blockchain
# THIS IS THE FULL NODE of the IoT Blockchain v0.1
# It contains all the ingredients for building a prime IoT Blockchain 
# Tested on Arduino Nano33 IoT. WiFiNINA firmware 1.4.0 and Library 1.7.0
# Last updated: Jan 19th 2021
# This contains code for: 1. connection (http server & client over wifi, 2. encryption, 3. hashing
# Integrating Access Point, Server, Client, Blockchain, Hash and RSA code. 
# Kudos to https://stackoverflow.com/users/6125661/telkepalli-venkat-karthik for experimental RSA
# Modified accordingly for maximum capacity via "long unsigned" keys, bounded and tested in range
# Implementing https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_algorithm
This code is experimental. It is a proof of the concept that autonomous IoT blockchain networks can be build based on minimal HW
