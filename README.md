Contains code for: 1. connection (http server & client over wifi, 2. encryption, 3. hashing
Integrating Access Point, Server, Client, Blockchain, Hash and RSA code. 
Kudos to https://stackoverflow.com/users/6125661/telkepalli-venkat-karthik for experimental RSA
Modified accordingly for maximum capacity via "long unsigned" keys, bounded and tested in range
Implementing https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_algorithm
This code is experimental. It is a proof of the concept that autonomous IoT blockchain networks can be build based on minimal HW.
